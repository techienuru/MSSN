            <img src="./images/logo.png" alt="logo">
            <p>The Muslim Students' Society of Nigeria popularly referred to
                th as MSSN was established on April 18 , 1954 and was officially
                launched at the Ansaruddeen Alakoro Mosque School Hall,
                th Lagos on 30 May 1954 amidst prayer, joy and exhortation. The
                antecedents of this noble struggle could be traced to the effort
                of the triumvirate of Tajudeen Adisa Aromoshodu, Sumola Akin
                Luguda and Abdurrahman Alade Sahid of the then Methodist
                Boys High School, Lagos.
                The idea of setting up an organization for Muslim students was
                born out of Muslims' desires to safeguard their religious
                fundamentals, culture and identity from the twin effects of
                forceful evangelization and alluring Christian activities.
                The history of colonial education in Nigeria had a remarkably
                coincidental relationship with Christian evangelism. As such,
                Muslim students at the initial stage had to study under the
                tutelage of Christian missionary society schools. The prevalent
                situation at that time necessitated Muslims to study under a
                very hostile environment where some of those students were
                reported to have changed their religion. Others who were
                steadfast and were willing to pursue their academic activities
                were forced to change their names. It was this type of forceful
                evangelization coupled with alluring activities that made the
                afore-mentioned trio to come together and call for the
                establishment of an organization whose principal aim was to serve as a rallying point and a platform for organized and
                concerted Da'awa activities in our educational institutions and a
                source for religious fulfillment for Muslim students.
                Within a year of the Society's formation, its branches spread to
                cover more schools in Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, llesha, IjebuOde, and Ikorodu. Two years later, the Society's presence
                covered virtually all government schools in the North.
                At the first conference of the society held in 1955, which was
                declared opened by Oba Adeniji Adele II of Lagos, Brother
                Abdullateef Adegbite and Brother A.R.A Sahid were elected as
                st the 1 National President and Secretary General respectively.
                Also at the conference, the late Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji
                Ahmadu Bello; Alhaji A.R.A. Smith of Ilesha; Dr. S.O. Biobaku;
                Alhaji Inuwa Wada, then Minister of Works; Mrs H.M.
                Shodeinde, M.B.E. and Alhaji Hummu Alaga of Ibadan were
                appointed patrons and patronesses of the society.
                The contributions of the MSSN to national development are
                enormous and these include, among other things, serving as a
                potent tool of national unity and cohesion. Apart from its
                membership that cuts across all the geographical and ethnic
                barriers, the MSSN promotes national integration and building
                bridges through its programmes and activities that emphasize
                the brotherhood of Islam, in particular, and mankind in general.
                Furthermore, the society has continued to produce generations of outstanding leaders in all spheres of national life, whilst
                defining and encouraging adherence to certain minimum
                standards of national ethos. The Society remains a pressure
                group working for the advancement of the interests of Muslims
                and Islam. Indeed, past members of the MSSN occupy
                leadership of virtually all leading Islamic organisations in
                Nigeria today.</p>
